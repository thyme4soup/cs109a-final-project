title: Predicting the 2018 Midterm Election
---
 
## Objective
 
The objective here is to use model selection and data methods from 2016 to predict the 2018 election outcome. 
 
## Methods and Results

### Selected Models

We selected the top-performing models found during testing and applied them to the test data. These models were LASSO, Ridge, Neural Network, and Random Forest.

### Results

| Model          | Accuracy on Full Test Data | Accuracy on Only Demographic Data |
|----------------|---------------------------:|----------------------------------:|
| LASSO          |                            |                                   |
| Ridge          |                            |                                   |
| Neural Network |                            |                                   |
| Random Forest  |                            |                                   |

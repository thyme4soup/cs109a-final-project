## Italian Olives

![](Italy.png)

I found this data set in the RGGobi book (http://www.ggobi.org/book/), from which the above diagram is taken. It has "the percentage composition of fatty acids
found in the lipid fraction of Italian olive oils', with oils from 3 regions of Italy: the North, the South, and Sardinia. The regions themselves are subdivided into areas as shown in the map above. The source for this data is:

>Forina, M., Armanino, C., Lanteri, S. & Tiscornia, E. (1983), Classification of Olive Oils from their Fatty Acid Composition, in Martens, H. and
Russwurm Jr., H., eds, Food Research and Data Analysis, Applied Science
Publishers, London, pp. 189â€“214.
